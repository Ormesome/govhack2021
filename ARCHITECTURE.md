# ARCHITECTURE

Built with javascript/React.

Hosted on Netlify.

Automated deployment from Github.

The data came from Excel, was imported into SQL Server in a Docker image, analysed with SQL queries, and exported to JSON for direct consumption by the application.

There is no live database - Netlify doesn't do that.
