# Script for the Video

We live in uncertain times, and I want to make some things less uncertain.

I had colleagues who were put on Job Keeper during the Brisbane COVID lockdown of 2020. They were unable to pay their bills, but they were also unable to get another job because the market was shrinking.

I had classmates who became mechanics or accountants because that was what they were good at at school and they didn't know that there were other options available.

The objective of this entry is to take the National Skills Commision data, and to leverage it to achieve it's primary goal: putting this information into the hands of the public in an accessible and easy to use format.

The data has been enriched with the ATO Individual Tax data for 2018-1019.

Perhaps my colleagues could have found roles that their skillsets aligned with enough to make a sideways career move viable and allowing them to support their families.

Perhaps my classmates could have chosen different occupations. Ones that they could be passionate about.


This entry is 1 part career guidance counsellor, 1 part employment services, and 1 part professional development.

Hi, I'm David, the data florist, making beautiful bouquets from your data.

Let's look at the application.

The application is hosted on govhack202 dot ormesome dot com.

Let's search by occupation.

After choosing an occupation we can see the skills that the NSC has identified are common to a role.

We can also see other occupations that have similar skillsets, and the average income for the industry as taken from the ATO taxable income dataset.

In this way we can explore occupations to see their required skills and expected salaries - something every job seeker and student is interested in.

We can also seach by skill

I wonder what my early years in the fast food industry prepared me for?

You can see that as I select more specific skills, the occupation list can become more specific, too.

Finally, we can search by competencies

These are much more broad in nature, and many occupations have the same competencies and are distinguished by their skills.

The project is on github, in the govhack2021 repository in the ormesome account

Here you can find the raw excel files, the etl process and the even the docker compose files.

There's plenty of opportunity for ongoing work - integrating Training Organisations, enabing School and University curriculum alignment, and individual career growth and skill assessment.
