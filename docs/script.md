# Script for the Video

We live in uncertain times, and I want to make some things less uncertain.

I had colleagues who, during the Brisbane lockdown of 2020, were put on Job Keeper. They were unable to pay their bills, but they were also unable to get another job because the market was shrinking.

I know people who became mechanics or accountants because that was what they were good at at school and they didn't know that there were other options available.

The objective of this entry is to take the National Skills Commision data, and to leverage it to achieve it's primary goal: putting this information into the hands of the public in an accessible and easy to use format.

Perhaps my colleagues could have found roles that their skillsets aligned with enough to make a sideways career move viable and allowing them to support their families.

Perhaps my classmates could have chosen different occupations. Ones that they could be passionate about.

Perhaps my own children will be able to find careers that they will enjoy and be good at.


This entry is 1 part career guidance counsellor, 1 part employment services, and 1 part professional development.

There's plenty of opportunity for ongoing work - integrating Training Organisations, School and University curriculum alignment, and individual career growth and skill assessment.


Let's look at the application.
