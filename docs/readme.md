## The Solution

The Occupation Interchange is a product designed to
* assist workers in post COVID Australia to recognise the skills they have acquired in their current role and to identify other roles that they may be suitable for;
* assist workers to plan their long term careers by comparing their current role to their dream role and to identify the areas of professional development;
* assist workers who have lost their jobs due to the economic downturn caused by COVID lockdowns to re-enter the workforce in previously unconsidered roles;
* assist students to convert their aptitude for classwork into workplace skills, allowing them to find meaningful work;
* assist stay-at-home parents, the long term unemployed, and those with disabilities to recognise the transferability of their daily tasks to a workplace environment;
* assist teachers and training organisations to address their teaching focus, identifying and targetting core employment skills;

## User Stories

I, as an employed or recently unemployed person, choose my occupation from a list. The system will provide me with the list of skills that are relevant to my occupation. I can mark them more or less important or leave the default settings. The application will then list for me occupations that match the selected skills with expected salary range.

I, as a student, choose my grades from a list. The system will provide me with the list of skills that those grades roughly correlate to. I can mark them more or less important or leave the default settings. The application will then list for me occupations that match the selected skills with expected salary range.

I, as a long term unemployed, choose my skills and competency from a list and indicate how important those skills are. The application will then list for me occupations that match the selected skills with expected salary range.

## Future Work

Click through on the occupation results list to show the skill gap between the original and chosen occupations.

Click through on the skill list and skill gap list to show the offerings from Training Organisations so that users can either search for ways to segway to a new role, or target a specific desired role.

Provide a graph of salaries over the past 10 years for the occupations in the result list. Extend the graph into the future based on the trend line.

Make the various lists alphabetical. Currently they're in ANZSCO Code order.
