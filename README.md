### Youth education and employment (National)

How might we use publicly available data to identify education and employment opportunities for our youth?

### Rethinking Education (QLD)

With COVID-19, we have had to re-think education. How can we provide a better and safer education using digital technologies that complement and enhance on campus experiences?
